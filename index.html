        <h1>Language learning</h1>
        <img class="pic1" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTu9NWALsnF4z4GMlfQvlZfAVGgheXxvo9nbg&usqp=CAU">
        <h3 class="language">When we think about language
         learning what comes to our mind first is learnig a
          lot of grammar rules and solve a lot of problems.
           After doing all this, we take few exams and
       <b>CONGRATULATIONS!!</b>You have learned the language!
       <br /><br />
       But languagre learning is not all about grammar and
       exam. A lot of people don't feel motivated because they 
       use these conventional methods and stop midway. <br />
       <br />
       Language learning is very interesting and fun if it is 
       learned the right way. Before that I want to say that 
       a lot of people learn the language which is selected by 
       their institution but a person should choose his or her 
       language. <br /><br />
       Here is a list of some languages which most of the
        people learn in educational institutions in
         conventional ways and loose their motivation:
       <ul class="li1">
           <li>ENGLISH</li>
           <li>SPANISH</li>
           <li>FRENCH</li>
           <li>GERMAN</li>
       </ul>
    
           This doesn't mean that people don't enjoy learning
           these. I will talk about it later.

       <h3 class="polyglot">Learning languages should be fun
        and it's not just about languages. We should learn
         everything in a 
       fun way. <br />
       I  want to tell you about one type of people
        who can speak different languages. They are POLYGLOTS.
        Most of the polyglots learn languages as hobbies and 
        they enjoy learning languages very much. There are 
        some polyglots who are very famous on YOUTUBE and T
        inspire a lot of people all over the world. You can 
        also watch their videos.<br />
         Here is a list of some  polyglots:

       <h3 class="misconception">
           There's a misconception about the characteristics 
           of a polyglot. Maybe you speak 4 languages and 
           considered as a polyglot. On the other hand, you 
           may speak 50 languages and not considered as a 
           polyglot. Just learning a few lines of a language
           doesn't make someone a polyglot. You have to be 
           able to communicate with people in your target
           language. There are 3 types of polyglot. 
           <ol class="li3">
               <li>Basic level fluent</li>
               <li>Conversation level fluent</li>
               <li>Native level fluent</li>
           </ol>
